## Example: Using Templates with AI Tools

You can use these templates as prompts with AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude to generate project documentation or outcomes in a conversational way. For example:

**Step-by-step Example:**

1. Open your preferred AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
2. Attach the relevant template file (e.g., `PRP_02_Requirements_Template.md`) directly in the AI chat, if the tool supports file uploads.
3. Provide context in your message, such as:
	> "Please help me fill out this requirements template for a web-based inventory management system. The template is attached."
4. The AI will analyze the attached file, guide you through each section, ask clarifying questions, and help you complete the document interactively.

**Sample Prompt:**

> "I am working on a new project. Here is a requirements template. Can you help me fill it out for an e-commerce website?"
> *(Paste template content)*

This approach allows you to leverage AI for collaborative, conversational documentation creation, ensuring completeness and clarity.
